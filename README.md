This is an extremely valuable app for Medical staff to be able to keep track of Patients information on a more personal level. 
Getting a CRM for a small medical practice, it is very expensive, so we wanted to create this as a substitute to allow them to experience the same benefits.


## Getting Started 

Simply open up the deployed link and explore the website. You can create a new account or, if you're a returning user, you can just log in. You can use our job search function to find jobs to populate your board with or use the custom form to input a job you've discovered elsewhere. If you're interested to see how you compare to other users on our site, you can take advantage of our data visualization features.

If you want to run your own local instance, follow the installation instructions included in this document.


### Installation
Inside your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the location of the cloned repo. Install the necessary dependencies by running either - 
```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn install
```
after the dependencies have been installed, you will need to make sure you have mongoDB configured on your computer as outlined in the next section.

If you already have mongoDB setup, you can run
```
yarn start
```
to intialize the app. It will launch the application at `http://localhost:3000` and you are now ready to search for random New York Times articles

### mongoDB
In order for the app to render locally, you will need to have mongoDB installed on your computer. Depending on your operating system, the installation proccess will be different. You can find more info on installing mongoDB through their documentation.
